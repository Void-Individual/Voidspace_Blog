# Voidspace Blog
This is a repository containing my code to build a personal blogging platform API using:
- C R U D for main operations
- Database MySQL
- data parsing with JSON

## Steps
- First, the base class must be created.
- The sub-classes to be used for creating this program must be created.
- An interactive terminal console is built, to handle the the program and ensure proper functionality as it starts up.
